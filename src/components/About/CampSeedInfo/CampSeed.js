  description:"2023 CAMPSPOT AWARDS WINNER: Best Campgrounds for Weekenders! If you enjoy off-roading in a dirtbike, ATV/UTV, or full-size vehicle, then you will love camping at Hidden Falls Adventure Park! Offering cabins, RV, and primitive tent sites, multi-day passes for riding: for every night that you camp in the park, you will be charged riding fees for the day before and the day after. These fees apply to both the driver and passenger and range from $15-$55 depending on stay. The price is well worth it with over 2,000 acres of off-road perfection! If you need to rent an off-road vehicle, Hill Country Adventure Rentals is recommended, as Hidden Falls does not provide rentals. The nearest gas station is 7 miles from the park. Onsite you will find bathrooms, showers, and a general store. Gear up and head out to Hidden Falls Adventure Park!" ,
