  description:"The race starts at 2:20:53pm (total eclipse begins) in Millinocket. The route will go out the Golden Road and at 3:34:15pm (total eclipse ends)all runners turn around wherever you are, and head back. Whoever goes furthest wins! In other words everyone will run out for 1 hour 13 minutes and 22 seconds before turning around . So If you’re feeling super competitive you can try to cover 12 miles or more before turning around, however if you’d prefer to run less and enjoy the show you can cover a mile and watch the sky instead!
Must have a garmin and a headlamp to race!" ,
